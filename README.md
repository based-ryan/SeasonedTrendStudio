The site should be roughly broken down into comments, which should allow for easy rearrangement of sections (i didn't uise section tags because i'm stubborn, and Div is all I ever will know). 
The CSS is pretty out of order, but hopoefully the comments should help figure it out a bit.
It's almost perfect on mobile, except for some navbar color scheme issues and kinda awkardly large cards at some resolutions.
